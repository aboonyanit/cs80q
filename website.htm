	<h2>AKSHAY SRIVATSAN</h2>
	<p>"I’ve noticed that there is a culture among some guys in tech which just try to exclude people who aren’t like them whether that’s race or gender. I think that discouraging people from [doing this sort of thing] needs to begin when kids are in elementary school to really establish in people’s mind that there isn’t a basis for this kind of bias." </p>

	<h2>KATHERINE WAISSBLUTH</h2>
	<p>"I was never silent about [responding to gendered commentary]. That’s another reason why those classes were kind of a toxic environment for me because it would’ve been better for my social life to shut up and take it. But, I couldn’t shut up and take it. So then, there was even more tension in the classroom.” </p>

	<p>"[Discrimination based on gender and race] is there, it is undeniable. Like, I’m not going to tell you its not there. But, I mean there are people that are there for you and are going to support you. There are resources here. It’s not impossible. It is going to be difficult, but it's not impossible." </p>

	<h2>LAUREN ZHU</h2>
	<p>"For my sophomore year summer, I did research at the University of Edinburgh. There was definitely fewer women; my professor as well as most of team was men. It was more intimidating, but I had to realize that I know a lot and I have to be unafraid to step up and let them know I’m totally capable." </p>
