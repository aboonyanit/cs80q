		<h2> <strong>Katherine Waissbluth </strong> is a freshman from Kings Mills, Ohio considering a major in CS+X with a combination of CS and English. She serves as an intern for Women in CS (WiCS).
 <br> <br>
		<strong>Major</strong></h2> 
		<p>
“I am really undecided about what I want to do after college, but I know that I love learning English and I love learning Computer Science, so I was like I’ll just study what I know I like right now.”
 </p>
<h2><strong>Career aspirations</strong> </h2>
<p>
“I am pretty flexible right now. I cannot see myself sitting at a desk writing code all day, but I am definitely super interested in ending up in the Tech industry in some way.”
</p>
<h2><strong>Personal experiences</strong></h2>
<p>
“On campus, I do not know if I have seen [race or gender discrimination] yet. Just because I haven’t even been here two months, but I am sure it’s there. It’s everywhere.”  <br> <br>
“At my high school, all the STEM classes that I was in - like I took Engineering 1, Engineering 2, AP Computer Science, BC Calc - it was usually me, maybe one or two other girls and like thirty guys, which was a pretty toxic environment to learn in. I kept thinking what’s that going to be like at Stanford - how is that going to change?”
“I think there’s just a stigma around women in stem. Of course it’s not something you’re supposed to pursue or something girls are supposed to be good at. And then, at my school especially because there was a group of guys who took all those classes, and it was a toxic group to be around especially as a woman. In my CS, or calc, or engineering class we would have group work. And no one wants a girl in their group. Like, if I have a question or want to answer a question, my answer is not valid or respected or paid attention to.”  <br> <br>
“I think of course I’ve been through that, my high school was super conservative. It was no big deal for anyone to say women can’t do this, women can’t do that, like girls are stupid, get back in the kitchen. Every day, no one even thought a thing about it.”  <br> <br>
“I was never silent about [responding to gendered commentary]. That’s another reason why those classes were kind of a toxic environment for me because like it would’ve been better for my social life to shut up and take it. But, I couldn’t shut up and take it. So then, there was even more tension in the classroom.”  <br> <br>
“I think that it's definitely the people [that makes STEM at Stanford accepting]. I haven’t seen the university go out of their way to encourage women in STEM. I think the Women in Computer Science group on campus is a really great resource, but the university themselves, I haven’t seen them trying to address the problem. I think that the fact that the students here are usually so great about it is sort of a drastic difference from where I went to high school.”  <br> <br>
“I do see a lot of diversity in CS106A, but I think as I start to get into higher CS classes, it will start to debalance.”
</p>
<h2><strong>Plans to take action</strong></h2>
<p>
“I think that being a successful woman in tech is a goal, in order to be a role model for other women. Of course, if I could end up on some sort of board or some sort of political front to help close the wage gap and to set actual standard for making sure women are included in the tech industry, that would be amazing.” <br> <br>
“I think that Stanford itself just needs to be more, have a bigger conversation about it. Like, they facilitated the Beyond: Sex Ed at NSO, but then there was nothing about diversity on campus or diversity in STEM, like gender equality kind of a thing. You can see that they are trying to start a conversation in some areas, but not in others.” <br> <br>
“I think just recognizing that there is always more to learn and experiences you don't know about. I think that it would be good for a lot of the guys in my dorm or in my classes to just like keep in mind that they don’t understand the struggles of a woman in STEM. Or, even myself, I’m sure there are women who have struggled more than me. I think that it is easy to be at Stanford and think “oh I know everything” or “I am so woke” kind of a thing, but it’s more important to have a mindset of always to be learning.” <br> <br>
“I really want to make computer science and STEM in general more accessible to women and work to end the stigma around being a woman in CS. I think that the best way to do this is to be a confident woman in CS, which is what I am going to try to do.”
“Computer Science was super intimidating because, it is going to sound really weird, but I hate computers. I hate technology. I am so not intuitive with it. But CS is more about problem solving and logic solving and not even about, I mean it’s about computers, but it’s so much more about the way that you think. And so I was super discouraged from taking CS in high school because I didn’t understand it. But, I went out on a whim and took it. It felt so good to be at the top of my class and show that the test scores don’t lie at all - all of these guys were like “what the heck”. And some of them, I really felt like I changed their perspective of women in STEM. And it does feel so good to work so hard at something and see that you are changing people’s perspectives. It can happen.”
